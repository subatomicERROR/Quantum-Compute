## Usage
You can interact with the Quantum-Compute API using HTTP requests. Below is an example of how to make a request to the `/quantum-compute` endpoint.

### Example Request
```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/quantum-compute/"
data = {"data": "your quantum data here"}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Endpoints
- **POST /quantum-compute/**: Accepts quantum data for computation and returns the results.
    - **Request Body**: 
        ```json
        {
            "data": "string"
        }
        ```
    - **Response**:
        ```json
        {
            "result": "computed result"
        }
        ```
